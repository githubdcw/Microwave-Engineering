## ðŸ”¶ 1. Definition of Microwave Band

- **Frequency Range**: 300 MHz to 300 GHz  
- **Wavelength**: 1 meter to 1 millimeter  
- Typically includes the **UHF**, **SHF**, and **EHF** bands.

## ðŸ”¶ 2. Key Differences from Lower Frequency Bands (e.g., HF, VHF)

| **Property**         | **Microwaves**                                           | **Lower Bands (HFâ€“VHF)**                    |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Propagation Mode** | Primarily **line-of-sight (LOS)**                        | **Ground wave**, **skywave**, LOS           |
| **Reflection**       | Reflected by **metallic objects**, less by ionosphere    | Reflected by **ionosphere** (HF)            |
| **Diffraction**      | **Limited diffraction** due to short wavelength          | Strong diffraction (around hills, buildings)|
| **Penetration**      | Poor through obstacles (walls, trees)                    | Better penetration in many cases            |
| **Antenna Size**     | **Small** directional antennas                           | **Large** antennas (especially HF)          |
| **Rain Attenuation** | **Significant** at higher frequencies                    | Minimal (except beyond ~10 GHz)             |
| **Usage**            | Radar, satellite, 5G, Wi-Fi, microwave ovens             | AM/FM radio, TV, maritime communications    |

## ðŸ”¶ 3. Types of Microwave Propagation

- **Line-of-Sight (LOS)**: Direct path between transmitter and receiver  
- **Troposcatter**: Scattering in the lower atmosphere (~50â€“500 km)  
- **Ducting**: Guided by atmospheric layers, enabling beyond-horizon communication  
- **Satellite**: Through the atmosphere to/from space  
- **Multipath**: Reflections off surfaces (e.g., water, buildings) cause interference

## ðŸ”¶ 4. Unique Challenges

- **Fading & Multipath**: Rapid signal strength fluctuations in mobile or urban areas  
- **Rain & Atmospheric Attenuation**: Especially problematic above **10 GHz**  
- **High Free-Space Path Loss**: Increases with frequency, needing high-gain antennas

## ðŸ”¶ 5. Applications

- **5G / 6G wireless systems**  
- **Wi-Fi** (2.4 GHz / 5 GHz / 6 GHz)  
- **Satellite communication** (C, Ku, Ka bands)  
- **Radar systems**  
- **Microwave ovens** (2.45 GHz)
